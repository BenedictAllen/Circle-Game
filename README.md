This was a really small project I completed about a year ago while bored in work experience.

In the game, you control a small circle with your mouse. The aim of the game is to enlarge your circle by consuming other, smaller circles. By moving your mouse to avoid the many much larger circles flying around, you can aim for smaller ones, increasing your size, and making everything easier.
